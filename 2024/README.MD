# Folder for the 2024 Advent of Code
You will find in this folder the solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code. Theses solutions are an aggregate of my own initial solutions and improvements and some ideas that I found online to improve the efficiency and conciseness of the code. Special credit goes to hyperneutrino and Reddit user 4HbQ that had some nice ideas. 
The goal for me this year was to write solutions in Python that are concise and reasonably fast.
